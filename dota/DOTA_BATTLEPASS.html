            <p>On May 6th, 2013, Dota 2 changed the gaming world forever when Valve released its first-ever Battle Pass.

            Then called the "Interactive Compendium," it acted as a precursor to the modern Battle Pass seen in several video games today. Valve continued to release Compendiums until 2015. For The International 2016, it was renamed, and the very first Dota 2 Battle Pass was released.

            The primary objective of the Battle Pass is to crowdfund the prize pool of The International. Dota 2 broke the record for the highest esports prize pool several times thanks to the Battle Pass. The current record is held by The International 9, which had a prize pool of $34.33 million.
